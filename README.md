# The Duodraigen's React TS + Vite App Template
This is my custom template to create a react app with Typescript and using
vite as a builder/development tool. It's just an alternative to the 
traditional `npm create vite@latest --template react-swc-ts` 
which adds eslint by default and that stuff. Well, i prefer to use it
with biome and add some extra features to the template

So, i basically created the template from scratch. I made a minimal blog
page to use basic react TS features and SPA ones in the way you can guide
through development :)

## Glossary
- `<pm>` is any of nodejs available package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, etc)

## How to
- Just clone the repository
- Do `cd react-ts-app-template` 
- Then do `<pm> install`
- Start development
- **Optional:** run `<pm> run dev` 

## Commands
- `<pm> run dev` to start development server
- `<pm> run build` to build the app
- `<pm> run preview` to preview the built app
- `<pm> run test` to run test suites

## What this template have
- Vite building and previewing (like `npm create vite@latest` apps does)
- Tailwind integration (postcss and autoprefixer plugins)
- Opinionated folder structure for project organization
- Linting done with @biomejs/biome
- Example images and favicons
- Path aliases configuration
- React Router Support
- Vitest integration
- Basic boilerplate
- SWC Transpilation
